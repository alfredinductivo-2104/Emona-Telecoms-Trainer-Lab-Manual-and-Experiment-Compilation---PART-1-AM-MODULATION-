## Emona Telecoms Trainer Lab Manual and Experiment Compilation (PART 1) 

## Background

The **Emona Telecoms Trainer 101** is an educational platform used by students to study the fundamental principles of **Communications and Telecommunications**. It provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing students to implement, observe, and analyze various communication system block diagrams using real hardware modules.

Through the use of the Emona Telecoms Trainer, students are able to explore key concepts in both **Analog** and **Digital Communications**, including:
- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Frequency Modulation (FM)
- Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
- Other fundamental communication techniques

This hands-on approach enables students to develop a deeper understanding of how communication systems operate—from **signal generation**, **modulation and demodulation**, **filtering**, and **amplification**, to overall system analysis.

The compiled set of experiments documents the **procedures**, **observations**, **results**, and **key notes** for each activity. Additionally, this compilation serves as a reference guide for other students by providing clear explanations, practical insights, and helpful tips to support effective experiment execution and deeper conceptual understanding.

## Experiment 1: Setting Up an Oscilloscope

## Introduction

An **oscilloscope** is an electronic measuring device used to analyze and observe electrical signals. It allows users to visualize signal characteristics such as **waveform shape**, **frequency**, and **amplitude**. In addition, an oscilloscope enables the measurement of important signal parameters including **period (T)**, **frequency (f)**, **peak voltage (Vp)**, **peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp)**, and **time intervals**. Oscilloscopes are widely used in electronics laboratories for **testing**, **troubleshooting**, and **verifying** the performance of electronic circuits and systems.

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to understand the different functionalities of an oscilloscope and to learn how to properly **set up and calibrate** the instrument in order to obtain **accurate and reliable measurements**. This activity also familiarizes students with the basic controls, measurement techniques, and proper setup procedures required for observing various electrical signals.

## Equipment to Be Used

1. Dual-channel 20 MHz Oscilloscope  
2. Oscilloscope probe (lead)

## Things You Need to Know

- **Amplitude** refers to the magnitude of a signal and is measured in volts (V). It is commonly measured either from the center of the waveform to its maximum value (peak voltage) or from the minimum to the maximum value (peak-to-peak voltage).
- The **period** of a signal is the time required to complete one full cycle and is measured in seconds (s). For faster signals, the period may be expressed in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs).
- **Frequency** is the number of cycles that occur in one second and is measured in hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies are commonly expressed in kilohertz (kHz) or megahertz (MHz).

## Procedure

1. Gather all necessary equipment for the activity and ensure that everything is easily accessible and ready for use.
2. Verify that all equipment is in good condition and functioning properly. Ensure that each device is correctly calibrated.
3. Under the **General Controls**:
   - Set the **Intensity Control** to approximately three-quarters of its maximum.
   - Set the **Mode Control** to the **CH1** position.

4. Under the **Vertical Controls**:
   - Set the **Input Coupling** for both channels to the **AC** position.
   - Set the **Vertical Attenuation** for both channels to **1 V/div**.
   - Set the **Vertical Attenuation Calibration** control to the **detent (locked)** position.
   - Adjust the **Vertical Position** controls for both channels to approximately the center of their travel.

5. Under the **Horizontal Controls**:
   - Set the **Timebase** to **0.5 ms/div**.
   - Set the **Timebase Calibration** control to the **detent (locked)** position.
   - Adjust the **Horizontal Position** control to approximately the center of its travel.

6. Under the **Triggering Controls**:
   - Set the **Sweep Mode** to **AUTO**.
   - Set the **Trigger Level** to the **detent (locked)** position, or approximately the midpoint if no detent is available.
   - Set the **Trigger Source** to **CH1** (or **INT**).
   - Set the **Trigger Coupling** to **AC**.
   - Set the **Slope (or Sync)** control to the **“+”** position.

7. Observe the display. The waveform shown should match the expected reference output.

8. This indicates that the oscilloscope is now **properly set up and calibrated**, and ready for use.

## Learnings

In this experiment, we were able to become familiar with the basic operation, setup, and calibration of an oscilloscope. We learned the importance of properly adjusting the general, vertical, horizontal, and triggering controls to obtain a stable and accurate waveform display. Correct calibration of the oscilloscope ensures that measurements are reliable and precise. Additionally, this experiment enhances our knowledge about the different functionalities and settings of an Oscilloscope. Overall, This experiment is very important to do whenever we will be using an Oscilloscope, as this ensures the accuracy and reliability of the output we will be gathered for the future experiments.
