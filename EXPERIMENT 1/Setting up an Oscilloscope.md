# SETTING UP AN OSCILLOSCOPE

---

## INTRODUCTION
An Oscilloscope is an electronic measuring device used to analyze and observe electrical signals. It allows the user to see the signal shape, frequency, and amplitude. Additionally, this device allows the user to measure different signal parameters such as the period (T), frequency (f), peak voltage (Vp), peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp), and time intervals. Oscilloscopes are widely used in electronics laboratories for testing, troubleshooting, and verifying the performance of electronic circuits and systems.

## OBJECTIVE
In this experiment, we will be able to understand the different functionalities of an oscilloscope and how to properly calibrate it before using it in order to obtain correct and accurate results. This activity will also familiarize students with the basic controls, measurement techniques, and proper setup of the instrument for observing various electrical signals

## EQUIPMENT TO BE USED:
1.	Dual Channel 20 Mhz Oscilloscope
2.	One Oscilloscope lead

## THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW:
- The amplitude of a signal is its physical size and is measured in volts (V). It is usually measured either from the middle of the waveform to the top (called the peak voltage) or from the bottom to the top (called the peak-to-peak voltage).
- The period of a signal is the time taken to complete one cycle and is measured in seconds (s). When the period is small, the period is expressed in milli seconds (ms) and even micro seconds (us).
- The frequency of a signal is the number of cycles every second and is measured in hertz (Hz). When there are many cycles per second, the frequency is expressed in kilo hertz (kHz) and even mega hertz (MHz)

### PROCEDURE OF SETTING UP AN OSCILLOSCOPE:
1.	Gather all necessary equipment for the activity, ensuring that everything is easily accessible and ready for use.
2.	Verify that all equipment is undamaged and functioning properly. Ensure each piece is correctly calibrated.
3.	In General Controls, Set the Intensity Control to about three quarters and Set the Mode control to the CH1 position
4.	In Vertical Control, Set the Input Coupling control for both channels to the AC position. Then, Set the Vertical Attenuation control for both channels to the 1 V/div position. After that, Set the Vertical Attenuation Calibration control for both channels to the detent (locked) position. Lastly, Set the Vertical Position control for both channels to about the middle of their travel 
5.	While in the, Horizontal controls: Set the Horizontal Timebase control to the 0.5ms/div position. Then, Set the Horizontal Timebase Calibration control to the detent (locked) position and lastly, Set the Horizontal Position control to about the middle of its travel. 
6.	In the Triggering controls, Set the Sweep Mode control to the AUTO position. Then, Set the Trigger Level control to the detent (locked) position. If it doesn't have a decent position, set it to about the middle of its travel. Then, Set the Trigger Source control to the CHI (or INT) position. Lastly, Set the Trigger Source Coupling control to the AC position iv) v) Set the Slope (or Sync) control to the "+" position.
7.	The displayed output must be like this.

8.	This indicate that the Oscilloscope is already setup and calibrated and it is ready to use. 

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RESULTS
- Through correct adjustment of the intensity, vertical attenuation, time base, and triggering controls, a stable and clear waveform was successfully displayed on the screen. This indicated that the oscilloscope was properly set up and calibrated.
- The experiment demonstrated that setting the vertical scale (V/div) correctly is essential for accurate voltage measurements, while proper adjustment of the horizontal scale (time/div) is necessary for precise determination of the signal’s period and frequency. Additionally, proper triggering settings were found to be important in stabilizing the waveform and preventing signal drift on the display.

## Learnings
In this experiment, we were able to become familiar with the basic operation, setup, and calibration of an oscilloscope. We learned the importance of properly adjusting the general, vertical, horizontal, and triggering controls to obtain a stable and accurate waveform display. Correct calibration of the oscilloscope ensures that measurements are reliable and precise. Additionally, this experiment enhances our knowledge about the different functionalities and settings of an Oscilloscope. Overall, This experiment is very important to do whenever we will be using an Oscilloscope, as this ensures the accuracy and reliability of the output we will be gathered for the future experiments.
