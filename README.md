This hands-on approach allows students to develop a deeper understanding of how each communication system operates, from **signal generation, modulation, demodulation, filtering of the signal, amplifying, and etc**.

The compiled set of experiments documents the procedures, observations, results, and key notes for each activity. Additionally, this compilation serves as a guide for other students by providing clear references, insights, and practical tips that can help them better understand the experiments and perform them more effectively.

## THINGS YOU MAY NEED TO KNOW

- **Amplitude** refers to the magnitude of a signal and is measured in volts (V). It is commonly measured either from the center of the waveform to its maximum value (peak voltage) or from the minimum to the maximum value (peak-to-peak voltage).
- The **Period** of a signal is the time required to complete one full cycle and is measured in seconds (s). For faster signals, the period may be expressed in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs).
- **Frequency** is the number of cycles that occur in one second and is measured in hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies are commonly expressed in kilohertz (kHz) or megahertz (MHz).
- Two signals that are in phase with each other are synchronized. That is, they go up and down at the same time.
- Two signals that out of phase are not synchronized. That is, they are out of step with each other.
- **Phase difference** describes how much two signals are out of phase and is measured in degrees (°).
- A sinewave is a repetitive signal with the shape.
- A cosine wave is simply a sinewave that is out of phase with another sinewave by exactly 90°.

#### 1.2 Observations

The experiment demonstrated that setting the vertical scale (V/div) correctly is essential for accurate voltage measurements, while proper adjustment of the horizontal scale (time/div) is necessary for precise determination of the signal’s period and frequency. Additionally, proper triggering settings were found to be important in stabilizing the waveform and preventing signal drift on the display.

## Experiment 1: Setting Up an Oscilloscope

## Introduction

An **oscilloscope** is an electronic measuring device used to analyze and observe electrical signals. It allows users to visualize signal characteristics such as **waveform shape**, **frequency**, and **amplitude**. In addition, an oscilloscope enables the measurement of important signal parameters including **period (T)**, **frequency (f)**, **peak voltage (Vp)**, **peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp)**, and **time intervals**. Oscilloscopes are widely used in electronics laboratories for **testing**, **troubleshooting**, and **verifying** the performance of electronic circuits and systems.
