## INTRODUCTION

The **Emona Telecoms Trainer 101** is a device used by the students in order to learn about the different principles of **Communications and Telecommunications**. It provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing students to implement and analyze various communication system block diagrams using real hardware modules.

Through the use of the Emona Telecoms Trainer, students are able to explore key concepts in both Analog and Digital Communications such as **Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), and other fundamental communication techniques**. This hands-on approach allows students to develop a deeper understanding of how each communication system operates, from **signal generation, modulation, demodulation, filtering of the signal, amplifying, and etc**.

The compiled set of experiments documents the procedures, observations, results, and key notes for each activity. Additionally, this compilation serves as a guide for other students by providing clear references, insights, and practical tips that can help them better understand the experiments and perform them more effectively.

## THINGS YOU MAY NEED TO KNOW

- **Amplitude** refers to the magnitude of a signal and is measured in volts (V). It is commonly measured either from the center of the waveform to its maximum value (peak voltage) or from the minimum to the maximum value (peak-to-peak voltage).
- The **Period** of a signal is the time required to complete one full cycle and is measured in seconds (s). For faster signals, the period may be expressed in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs).
- **Frequency** is the number of cycles that occur in one second and is measured in hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies are commonly expressed in kilohertz (kHz) or megahertz (MHz).
- Two signals that are in phase with each other are synchronized. That is, they go up and down at the same time.
- Two signals that out of phase are not synchronized. That is, they are out of step with each other.
- **Phase difference** describes how much two signals are out of phase and is measured in degrees (°).
- A sinewave is a repetitive signal with the shape.
- A cosine wave is simply a sinewave that is out of phase with another sinewave by exactly 90°.

#### 1.2 Observations

The experiment demonstrated that setting the vertical scale (V/div) correctly is essential for accurate voltage measurements, while proper adjustment of the horizontal scale (time/div) is necessary for precise determination of the signal’s period and frequency. Additionally, proper triggering settings were found to be important in stabilizing the waveform and preventing signal drift on the display.

### 2. Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101 Modules

In the second experiment, the focus is on the **Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101**, where we are able to explore and identify the different modules available on the trainer and understand the specific function of each one.

### 2.1 Master Signals Module

The first module being tested was the **Master Signals Module**. By connecting this module to a calibrated oscilloscope, we were able to observe the different reference signals generated by the trainer.

#### 2.1.1 Observed Analog Signals

Using the oscilloscope, we were able to observe the three different **analog signals** available in the Emona Trainer:

##### 2 kHz Sine Wave

#### 2.1.2 Measured Values of the Given Analog Signals

Using the oscilloscope’s Measure function, we were able to determine the output voltage, frequency, and period produced by the master signals. The measured values are shown in the table below.

### 2.2 Speech Module

The second module being tested was the **Speech Module**. Since one of the primary purposes of communication equipment is the transmission of speech, it is useful to examine the operation of such equipment using signals generated from speech.

#### 2.2.1 Oscilloscope Connection

Using a calibrated oscilloscope, the **Speech Module** was connected, and the **oscilloscope timebase control** was adjusted until the speech signal was clearly displayed.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbe3d9d6-d532-4f1e-a2e0-6ffe37fe8578" width="500" height="380"/>

#### 2.2.2 Observing Speech Signals

After establishing the connection, variations in the waveform were clearly observed on the oscilloscope as we spoke into the microphone. This demonstrated how **speech signals change in amplitude and shape** in response to vocal input.

### 2.3 Buffer Module

The third module tested was the **Buffer Module**, which is designed to amplify a given input signal. It also serves as an interface between devices and circuits that cannot be directly connected.

#### 2.3.1 Observing the Buffer Module

To observe the effect of the **Buffer Module**, a **2 kHz sine wave** from the Master Signals Module was used as the input. A calibrated oscilloscope was connected to both the input and output of the Buffer Module to clearly compare and observe the changes in the signal.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5404bc7c-9120-424a-b240-93d59bece0d4" width="500" height="380" />

#### 2.3.2 Observations

Upon applying the input signal to the Buffer Module, it was observed that adjusting the **Gain control** allowed the amplitude of the input signal to be increased. Which we can clearly see in the figure below. We can see also in the Figure below that the output voltage of the inputted signal has increase significantly from 3.920 V to 16.80 V as we turn the gain control fully clockwise.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e1818bc-e682-4810-aa01-601e6708ec4f" width="500" height="380" />

### 2.4 Adder Module

The fourth module tested was the **Adder Module**, which simply adds two signals together.

#### 2.4.1

To observe what happened to the signal when it undergo the adder, we connect a **2 kHz Sine wave** input and connect the Adder module output to the Oscilloscope.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deb076b4-4d9a-4bf2-afb0-1b6f6c3c5c17" />

#### 2.4.2

As observe the signal if we adjust the gain control fully **anti-clockwise** in the Adder Module, the signal's output is a **flat line or zero**.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f83c91ed-3afe-4215-b21e-7b7e12091600" />

#### 2.4.3

Conversely, as we increase the gain or turn the gain control clockwise, the output signal gets bigger and is amplified. The output voltage also increased from **3.80 V (original Vo)** to **8 V** as the signal flows through the Adder with high gain.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fcd9a7e-5bba-43af-95cc-73afc5e9dd95" />

### 2.5 Phase Shifter Module

The fifth module tested was the **Phase Shifter Module**, which is used for communication systems that require the signal to be transmitted with a phase shift.

#### 2.5.1

Using a **2 kHz Sine wave** and connecting it to the Phase Shifter Module and the Oscilloscope to the output, we are able to see the effect of this module if we switch the phase from **0° to 180°** or vice versa, or adjust the phase adjust control in the module.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ead876b-6ddd-4410-8da4-2499a00029a3" />

#### 2.5.2

Upon adjusting the Phase control about the middle of its travel, it is observed that the signal starts to shift about **90°**, which is right in the middle of the 0° to 180° range. While the timing has changed

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d55a6380-b84f-4ecc-8c60-c6c2aa02085e" />

### 2.6 Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)

The sixth module tested was the **Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**, which is similar to the Master Signals Module. However, unlike the Master Signals Module, which is limited to two outputs (one analog and one digital), the VCO provides **six outputs**, three for each type of signal. The main advantage of the VCO is that it allows the user to **control the output frequency**, whereas the Master Signals Module provides only fixed frequencies.

#### 2.6.1

Since the VCO itself generates the signal, **no input signal is required**. The module was directly connected to a calibrated oscilloscope for observation.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f21018a-b5b9-484a-9e29-4df64a16d9f7" />

#### 2.6.2

Upon observing the VCO output, it was noted that the signal frequency was not completely stable and varied depending on the control setting. In the example shown in the figure, the VCO control was rotated **counterclockwise**, resulting in a **low frequency** and a signal that appeared less stable on the oscilloscope.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dc735ed-5edc-4fdc-bf92-3b7b7179bc73" />

#### 2.6.3

Additionally, as we adjusted the Gain Control, the amplitude of the output signal increased or decreased accordingly, demonstrating the VCO’s ability to modify signal strength. By using the Frequency Adjust Control, we observed a continuous change in the output frequency, showing that the VCO allows precise tuning of the signal frequency over a specific range. While, Adjusting the Range Control shifted the overall frequency limits of the VCO, enabling the output to operate within low, medium, or high-frequency ranges.

### 3. Modelling Equations using the Emona Telecoms-Trainer

### 3.1 Combining Two Sine Wave Signals

Two 2 kHz sine wave signals were used as input and passed through the Phase Shifter and Adder Module. In the first part, we used the Adder Module to combine the two 2 kHz sine signals, as shown in the figure below.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdde3624-67d6-4671-9be7-50ebc269ca13" />

OUTPUT
<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8b2d39-a6b0-46e0-aa25-cdd4caa0e7f9" />

#### 3.1.1

Using the Gain Control function, we adjusted the gain until the output matched the size of the input. In the experiment, we measured an output voltage of 3.8 V and an input voltage of 3.8 V, which clearly shows that **Voltage Output = Voltage Input** when the gain is properly adjusted.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d56c285-c4a7-41ea-8384-3c7df0c4b03e" />

### 3.2 Phase-Shifted Input through Adder Module

After that, we changed the other input of the Adder Module and first passed it through the Phase Shifter Module, with the output then connected back to the Adder Module, as shown in the figure below.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c5aa84b-f2e3-40c0-85e6-4fb2fbc3cd03" />

#### 3.2.1
As observed, the output voltage is now different from the previous case when the same input signal passed through the Adder alone. While the output voltage, frequency, and period remain the same, it is clearly observable that the **phase of the output signal has changed**. This occurs because one input is a regular sine wave, while the other is a phase-shifted signal. When these signals are combined, the result is a sine wave with a phase shift corresponding to the adjusted input.

<img width="500" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/601bdffe-c149-47c1-b07a-15a1d2e72232" />
